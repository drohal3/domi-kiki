price: ~ 100€

Budapest <-> Slovakia
------
We do not have experience with travelling this route. However, from Budapest, there are 2 main options:

- Option 1: train to Košice
  - national operators ZSSK and MAV  
- Option 2: Flixbus bus to Prešov
  
Košice/Prešov <-> Bardejov
------
Do not buy tickets in advance!

Use <a href="https://cp.sk/">cp.sk</a> (Slovak language only) to find connections from Prešov or Košice to Bardejov.
2 main options are:
- <strong>local trains:</strong> you can buy tickets at the train stations or online (<a href="https://www.zssk.sk/en/">ZSSK</a>)
- <strong>local buses (SAD):</strong> buy tickets from driver (cash or maybe also payment card)
