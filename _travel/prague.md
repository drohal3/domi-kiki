From Prague to Bardejov it is 10+ hours by train
There is also an option to take a night train from Prague to Kysak.

When travelling i.e. with RegioJet to Kysak, we recommend buying ZSSK tickets from Kysak to Bardejov before departure (online or at train station). Avoid transfers at nigh. Kysak is in the middle of nowhere and you might end up waiting very long time for next train to Prešov and then Bardejov.
