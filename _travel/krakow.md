Traveling through Krakow is the fastest and most convenient way to reach Bardejov from Helsinki.

Flight tickets (Helsinki <-> Krakow)
------
- Finnair
- Lufthansa (transfer)
- AirBaltic (transfer)

price: ~ 100€

Krakow <-> Bardejov
------
Direct bus, operated by <a href="https://global.flixbus.com/">Flixbus</a>

Price: ~ 12-20€

Recommended
------
We suggest taking the early morning Finnair flight from Helsinki arriving in Krakow at 8:10AM.
It gives a time to walk around the city center and leaves enough buffer time to make it to the Flixbus bus leaving for Bardejov at 15,50PM.

Krakow is a beautiful city. We recommend staying one or two nights in it.
