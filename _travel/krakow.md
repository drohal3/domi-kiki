Restaurants
------
**Milkbar Tomasza** ([Google maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/16jyWWM4bF68pULcA))

Delicious and affordable food. They offer a discounted daily lunch menu, and **we highly recommend the pierogi filled with potatoes and cheese**. The kompot (a fruity drink) is also worth trying, though it can be better elsewhere.

**Beer House** ([Google maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ptUHs5DfKZrJ6Xfy8))

Less traditional food. Good quality for affordable price. They also offer discounted daily lunch menu.

**Dobra Pączkarnia** ([Google maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eUBHFRiuJkLf4wSM6))

All sweet tooths should not miss amazing Polish doughnuts. You will explore quality and flavors which are in different league from the polish doughnut chains.

Attractions
------
You should visit at least central square with market hall and beautiful church. From the square, take the road towards Wawel Castle. If you have more time, visit Jewish quarter, Shindler Factory, Auschwitz or Spectacular Wieliczka salt mine. For the Auschwitz andsalt mine we recommend booking guided tours (they also offer both in one) through verified booking services.
If you have even more time, and you are into these things, visit amusement park Energylandia.
