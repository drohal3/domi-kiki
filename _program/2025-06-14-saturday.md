14:00 - church ceremony

The official part of our wedding starts with the ceremony in Basilica of St Giles
(Bazilika sv. Egídia). (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/p47WbaEFNMedrofF9">location<a/>)

Please, arrive a few minutes in advance to have enough time to find a spot in the church.

15:00 - moving to the venue
------
The reception and the party will take place in Stodola. (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/B6woWxvKjGQqjauA8">location</a>)

**How to get to the venue?**

After the ceremony, stay in front of the church, next to the bells.
The appointed people will assure smooth tranzit to the venue. We will utilize seats in the other guest's cars.
The last resort for the people who do not fit in the cars is a taxi (~5 euros per car). 

We will provide information about getting to the venue later. The last resort is a taxi which should not cost much more than 5 euros per car.

We are estimating to begin the party at 16:00. It might take a time until everyone arrives and food gets served.

Getting back to the hotel
-------
People will move back to their hotels individually. We recommend people to go in the groups by taxi or (not drunk volunteer with car).
