14:00 - church ceremony
------
The official part of our wedding starts with the ceremony in Basilica of St Giles
(Bazilika sv. Eg√≠dia). (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/p47WbaEFNMedrofF9">location<a/>)

Please, arrive a few minutes in advance to have enough time to find a spot in the church.

15:00 - moving to the venue
------
The reception and the party will take place in Stodola. (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/B6woWxvKjGQqjauA8">location</a>)

We will provide information about getting to the venue later. The last resort is a taxi which should not cost much more than 5 euros per car.

We are estimating to begin the party at 16:00. It might take a time until everyone arrives and food gets served.
