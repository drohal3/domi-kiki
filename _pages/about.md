This website will provide instructions how to get to the venue and other useful information for guests, especially those travelling from abroad.

General Information
======
Dominik and Kristina will say their "yes" (or "no"?) in church Bazilika sv. Egidia in Bardejov. The ceremony will begin at 2pm.

The reception / wedding party will start after the church ceremony. The guests will be invited for it individually.

Wedding gifts
------
The best gift that we can receive from our guests is that they will make the journey to the beautiful medieval town Bardejov and celebrate our wedding with us.

However, if you still wish to give us some wedding gift (not required), you can give it to us in Finland (so you nor us need to travel with it) or financially help us with starting our future together.
