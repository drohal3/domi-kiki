At least, Friday - Sunday (the weekend of our wedding),
we will not be able to provide accommodation to our friends.

We recommend booking through services such as Airbnb or Booking.

Bardejov is a small, but beautiful and historical town. It is enough to arrive on Thursday or Friday before the wedding and leave on Sunday. There are many beautiful places in Slovakia and around worth visiting if you have extra days to travel.
